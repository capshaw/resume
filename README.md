# Resume

Hi world! This is how I build my resume. I use HTML / CSS (SASS) to create a webpage that I later turn into a PDF when applying for positions.

Feel free to check it out and poke around. It's a neat hack -- and needs a good refactoring -- so don't judge the messiness too much!

In the future, I'd like to make this document responsive.
