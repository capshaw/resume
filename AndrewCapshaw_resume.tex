\textsc{about}

I am a Software Engineering Manager currently working at Indeed in Austin, TX. During my nine years at Indeed I have worked as both an individual contributor as well as in technical and managerial leadership positions. As a manager, my \href{https://capsh.net/manager-beliefs/AndrewCapshaw_beliefs.pdf}{coaching philosophy}\footnote{\url{https://capsh.net/manager-beliefs/AndrewCapshaw_beliefs.pdf}} centers around thoughtfully serving my team to put them in the best position to be successful.

\textsc{experience}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{}r | X@{}}
2019 $\rightarrow$ Present &  \textbf{Software Engineering Manager} – Indeed  \\
\small{4 years}  & I currently lead a software engineering team at Indeed focused on the enterprise employer segment. We build tools to help enterprises manage their large number of jobs on Indeed effectively. Pervious to this I was an engineering manager on Indeed Hire, a team building an internal recruiting agency for Indeed.

\bigskip
As a manager, I mentor, grow, and evaluate my team. I work with individuals on personal opportunities for growth, with our PM and UX leads to co-lead the team, and with the team as a whole to ensure we are focusing on the right work.

\textit{Current Responsibilities}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, leftmargin=2em, label=\raisebox{0.25ex}{\tiny$\bullet$}]
\item Coach, mentor, grow, and evaluate a team of software engineers (average of 5, up to 8)
\item Collaborate with product management to prioritize, define, and measure the impact of product changes
\item Ensure smooth deployment of new features via iterative team process changes
\item Conduct interviews for software engineers and managers (600+ lifetime at Indeed)
\item Provide technical mentorship to my team and others
\item Design and implement product features
\end{itemize}

\\
2017 $\rightarrow$  2019 &  \textbf{Senior Software Engineer / Team Lead} – Indeed \\ 
\small{2 years}  & During my time on Indeed Hire, I was the tech lead on several teams, building out architectural pieces of code, mentoring new hires and working with product managers to plan and realize our goals. I also participated in Indeed's onboarding experience for new hires (Indeed University) as a lead. I mentored new hires while getting some first-hand experience being a manager.
