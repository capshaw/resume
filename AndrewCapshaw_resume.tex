\textsc{about}

I am a Software Engineering Manager currently working at Indeed in Austin, TX. I've been at Indeed for around seven years. During this time, I have worked as both an individual contributor as well as in technical and managerial leadership positions. My \href{https://capshaw.me/posts/19/}{coaching philosophy} centers around thoughtfully serving my team. I favor listening over talking, trust over micro-management.
